# Welcome

Welcome to my code notes. That is not another blog. I will publish here some my thought about programming. That's all.

# About me

I’m a coffee addicted IT enthusiast. Making software became my passion. In my day to day job I’m focused on business needs and best quality of designed solution. Now acting as Software Architect but I still enjoy making good code. Learn a lot and still have fun in doing IT. 

Working mostly with Java and Spring, test in Spock.

But I'm also interested with Kotlin and Go.
